Bugs
----
- Songlist surrounded with border
- Song length in seconds, not minutes


Todo
----
- implement websocket on frontend
- change nowplaying to be in-memory
- implement the createdb threading
- improve the directories page:
  - switch from put to post/delete
- add some error handling on the ajax calls
- add a "back to player" button
- I am guessing that nowplaying should be a directive

Later
-----
- add the ability to manually add one song to the database
- add use of atexit and ConfigParser modules
