Bugs
----
- Thread not stopping when cherrypy stops
- Songs stopping randomly
- Songlist surrounded with border
- Song length in seconds, not minutes
- I am guessing that nowplaying should be a directive

Todo
----
- improve the directories page:
  - switch from put to post/delete
- add some error handling on the ajax calls
- add a "back to player" button
- poll for volume change

Later
-----
- add the ability to manually add one song to the database
- add use of atexit and ConfigParser modules
