TODO
----
- try to get the current song to highlight in the songlist when the song auto changes
- clean up the mess in songs.py
- fix playerctl.py so that you can start the player from the web
- fix playerutils.py so that it can refresh the database without rerunning (and possibly change createsongdb so that it issues the refresh command)
- add the ability to manually add one song to the database
- add use of atexit and ConfigParser modules
